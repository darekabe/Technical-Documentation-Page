            <p>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to 
                give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? 
                Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? 
                A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. 
                This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>

            <header>HTML Head</section>
                <p class="p1">The HTML head is the contents of the <code> &lt;head&gt; </code> element — unlike the contents of the <code> &lt;body&gt; </code> element (which are displayed on the page when loaded 
                    in a browser), the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the document. 
                    In the above example, the head is quite small:</p>
        <section class="main-section" id="HTML_Text_Fundamentals">
            <header>HTML Text Fundamentals</header>
            <p class="p1">One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way its developer intends.
                This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating 
                lists, and more.</p>
            <p class="p2">Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.

                An example of a newspaper front cover, showing use of a top level heading, subheadings and paragraphs.
                
                Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.
                
                In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a <code> &lt;p&gt; </code>  element, like so:<code> &lt;/p&gt; </code>  </p>
            <p class="p2">

                    <code> &lt;h2&gt; </code>Chapter 1: The dark night<code> &lt;/h2&gt; </code><br>

                    <code> &lt;p&gt; </code>It was a dark night. Somewhere, an owl hooted. The rain lashed down on the ...<code> &lt;/p&gt; </code><br>

                    <code> &lt;h2&gt; </code><br>Chapter 2: The eternal silence<code> &lt;/h2&gt; </code><br>

                    <code> &lt;p&gt; </code>Our protagonist could not so much as a whisper out of the shadowy figure ...<code> &lt;/p&gt; </code><br>

                    <code> &lt;h3&gt; </code>The specter speaks<code> &lt;/h3&gt; </code><br>

                    <code> &lt;p&gt; </code>Several more hours had passed, when all of a sudden the specter sat bolt upright and exclaimed, "Please have mercy on my soul!"<code> &lt;/p&gt; </code>
                    </code><br><br>
                    It's really up to you what the elements involved represent, as long as the hierarchy makes sense. 
                    You just need to bear in mind a few best practices as you create such structures:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="indent">Preferably, you should use a single <code> &lt;h1&gt; </code> per page—this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.</li>
                        <li class="indent">Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy.</li>
                        <li class="indent"> Don't use <code> &lt;h3&gt; </code> elements to represent subheadings, followed by <code> &lt;h2&gt; </code> elements to 
                            represent sub-subheadings—that doesn't make sense and will lead to weird results.</li>
                        <li class="indent">Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it is necessary.</li>
                        <li class="indent">Documents with many levels (for example, a deep heading hierarchy) become unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable 
                            to spread the content over multiple pages if possible.</li>
                    </ul>

            <p class="p1">Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the web a web. 
                This article shows the syntax required to make a link and discusses best practices for links.</p>
                <p class="p2">
                    A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, see Block level links, inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.<br>
                        <code>
                        <code>&lt;p&gt; </code> I'm creating a link to <br>
                        <code>&lt;a&gt; </code> href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage<code>&lt;/a&gt; </code>.
                        <br><code>&lt;/p&gt; </code>
                        </code><br>
                        This gives us the following result:
                        <p class="p2">I'm creating a link to
                            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
                            </p>

            <p class="p1">When writing code of some kind, everything is usually fine, until that dreaded moment when an error occurs — you've done 
                something wrong, so your code doesn't work — either not at all, or not quite how you wanted it to. For example, the following shows 
                an error reported when trying to compile a simple program written in the Rust language.

               <p class="p2"> A console window showing the result of trying to compile a rust program with a missing quote around a string in a print statement. 
                The error message reported is error: unterminated double quote string.Here, the error message is relatively easy to understand — "unterminated 
                double quote string". If you look at the listing, you can probably see how println!(Hello, world!"); might logically be missing a double quote. 
                However, error messages can quickly get more complicated and less easy to interpret as programs get bigger, and even simple cases can look a little 
                intimidating to someone who doesn't know anything about Rust. </p>
                
                <p class="p2">Debugging doesn't have to be scary though —  the key to being comfortable with writing and debugging any programming language or code is 
                familiarity with both the language and the tools.</p></p>
